In simple words, Jenkins Pipeline is a combination of plugins that support the integration 
and implementation of continuous delivery pipelines using Jenkins. The pipeline as Code 
describes a set of features that allow Jenkins users to define pipelined job processes with 
code, stored and versioned in a source repository.
Why do we need to use Jenkins Pipeline: -
- Pipelines are better than freestyle jobs, you can write a lot of complex tasks using pipelines 
when compared to Freestyle jobs.
- You can see how long each stage takes to execute so you have more control compared to 
freestyle.
- Pipeline is a Groovy based script that has a set of plug-ins integrated for automating the 
builds, deployment and test execution.

- Pipeline defines your entire build process, which typically includes stages for building an 
application, testing it and then delivering it.
- You can use a snippet generator to generate pipeline code for the stages where you don't 
know how to write groovy code.
